            <h2>Why cultural tourism?</h2>
          <h3>Cultural tourism - an answer to contemporary challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Cultural tourism can be defined in many ways. Here it means a type of tourism activity in which the visitor's essential
            motivation is to learn, discover, experience and consume the
            tangible and intangible cultural attractions/products in a tourism
            destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a response to global challenges such as climate change, resourse
            scarcity and health challenges more and more wisdom of native
            peoples is required to achieve a better balance between nature and
            economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cultural tourism is not banalisation, exotism or show. Many native people
            worldwide have access to education,politics and any other sphere.
            However, colonialism, racism and discriminatory practises remain
            everywhere in places that were once colonies. Tourism remains a sustainable and resourceful alternative form of income for many communities.

          <h3>Inche Mapuche</h3>
          <p>
            Mapu means, not only 'earth'
            as commonly translated, but it contains all that is known: the space
            above (Wenumapu), the space in between (Nag Mapu) and that which is
            below (Minche Mapu). Che means 'people'. It contains more than one
            culture, typically depending on the region of origin that are united
            by a common language family. Mapu-che means people that live and
            belong to their environment. As a woman with mapuche tehuelche roots
            myself, I am proud of my native roots and other cultures and would
            like to share it with others, while meeting other friend first
            nation cultures and learning from each other.
